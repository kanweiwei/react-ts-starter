# react-ts-starter
This project was based on `create-react-app` and `create-react-app-typescript`.

(https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

(https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

## How to start
use   `npm` or `yarn`
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kanweiwei/react-ts-starter
$ cd react-ts-starter
$ yarn install
$ yarn run dev

```
Now you can visit [http://localhost:3006/](http://localhost:3006/)

## How to build
```bash
$ yarn run build
```
The files built can be seen in the 'public' directory.

## UI Library
I have chosen the [Ant-design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) for you, besause it is maintained by a nice team of Alipay. So you can use it directly for convenience.

Because of antd, I added `less-loader`, so the starter both support less and scss css preprocessor.
